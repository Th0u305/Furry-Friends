</ul><h2>Features</h2>
<hr><ul>
<li>Arrow Functions: ES6 provides a feature known as Arrow Functions. It provides a more concise syntax for writing function expressions by removing the "function" and "return" keywords.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Promises: In ES6, Promises are used for asynchronous execution. We can use promise with the arrow function. Promises are a powerful tool for handling asynchronous operations in a more readable and manageable way</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>ForEach : When working with arrays, it’s widespread to iterate through its elements and manipulate them. Traditionally this can be done using for, while or do-while loops. The forEach will call the function for each element in the array.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Template Literals: Template literals offer a cleaner way to handle string interpolation in JavaScript. They use backticks (`) to enclose strings, allowing variables to be embedded directly within the string using ${variable}. This feature simplifies string concatenation and enhances code readability.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>Classes: ES6 introduces a class syntax for creating objects, making it more structured and similar to other object-oriented languages. It simplifies the process of defining constructor functions and prototypes, leading to more organized and maintainable code.</li>
</ul>
